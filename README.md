# Blockchain hashing simulation created by Barak
Steps to start the simulation:
  * Execute the project in CodeBlocks.
  * If you don't know a blockchain txt file directory, just write "BlockChain.txt".
  * Now you'll have opened the default blockchain.
  * Select the option you want.
  * Selecting the option 1, you will see the entire blockchain (all blocks), typing the option 2, you can view the last created block,
     and if you want to mine or create a block, select the option 3.
